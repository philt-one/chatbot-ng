## Features ðŸš€

1. **Convivial User Interface (UI)**: The chatbot UI was designed similarly to ChatGPT. It's easy-to-use, intuitive and highly responsive.
2. **Text-to-Speech Capabilities**: Incorporating cutting-edge TTS technology, the chatbot vocalizes the assistant's responses.
3. **Versatile Use Cases**: Whether you're building assistive technology or interactive tools, the chatbot fits right in!

## Getting Started ðŸŽ¬

**1. Clone Repo**

```bash
cd chatbot-ng
git clone https://github.com/philt-one/chatbot-ng.git
```

**2. Provide OpenAI API Key**

Create a .env file in the root of the repo with your OpenAI API Key:

```bash
cp .env.example .env
```

> You can set `OPENAI_API_HOST` where access to the official OpenAI host is restricted or unavailable, allowing users to configure an alternative host for their specific needs.

> Additionally, if you have multiple OpenAI Organizations, you can set `OPENAI_ORGANIZATION` to specify one.

**3. Run App**

```bash
docker compose up -d
```

**4. Use It**

You should be able to start chatting! The UI should be accessible on http://localhost:3000/
